# Kiview
Kiview gives the user the ability to quickly preview different file types without the need to launch the default application.
### Supported file types:
.txt,.sh,.pdf,.doc,.docx,.odt,.ods,.xlsx,.xls,.csv,.odp,.ppt,.pptx,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.kra,.svgz,.svg,.mp4,.mp3,.webm,.zip,.gz,.xz,.rar

## Known Issues
Currently due to the way it integrates with dolphin, the last item copied to the clipboard is modified and then restored. This isn't a problem if it's just text, but unfortunately it can't restore the contents if the last item copied was a folder or file.

### How it works
To use it you need to set a keyboard shortcut via plasma settings and invoke it while a dolphin window is active.   
Any key combination is fine to activate the shortcut and it is only necessary to enter this command in the appropriate section: `kiview` (for the non-flatpak version) or `flatpak run com.nyre.kiview` (for the flatpak version).
